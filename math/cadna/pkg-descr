The CADNA (Control of Accuracy and Debugging for Numerical Applications)
software estimates round-off errors in numerical simulations.

CADNA uses the CESTAC method to estimate in any computed result which digits are
affected by round-off errors. Moreover CADNA implements all the concepts and
definitions of the stochastic arithmetic, specially the definitions of order
relations and equality relation. To be very short, these definitions take into
account the accuracy of the operands. Therefore CADNA enables a real numerical
debugging by detecting numerical instabilities which usually involve numerical
noise. The last (but not the least) tool provided by CADNA is that data errors
can be taken into account for the estimation of the final accuracy.
