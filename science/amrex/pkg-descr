AMReX is a software framework containing all the functionality to write
massively parallel, block-structured adaptive mesh refinement (AMR)
applications.

Key features of AMReX include:
- Primarily C++ with Fortran interfaces available
- Support for 1D, 2D and 3D
- Support for cell-centered, face-centered, edge-centered, and nodal data
- Support for particles and particle-mesh operations
- Support for embedded boundary (cut cell) representations of complex geometries
- Support for hyperbolic, parabolic, and elliptic solves on hierarchical
  adaptive grid structure
- Optional subcycling in time for time-dependent PDEs
- Hybrid parallelization strategy based on MPI+X, where X is OpenMP for
  multicore architectures, and primarily CUDA for architectures including NVIDIA
  GPUs and HIP for architectures including AMD GPUs
- Highly efficient parallel I/O, including native and hdf5 format
- Plotfile format supported by AmrVis, VisIt, ParaView, and yt.
